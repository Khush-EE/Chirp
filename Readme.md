All the html files are located in templates folder which is in home folder. All css and js files are located in static folder. The css page name is always same as its html name. You can edit them.

## Data Models
The data is stored in two SQL tables namely `users` and `chirps`, where user tables contains the users data and chirps contains all the post from various users (similar to tweets). In users table you have data fields
- username
- email
- profile_pic
- headline
- bio
- name
- password

And in chirps table, we have
- user
- content
- image
- datetime

You dont have to write any SQL, its already written in backend, you just need to use this fields to create an amazing UI. Some of this fields have been used in the templates. To use this variables, you have to enclose them in two curly braces like `{{user.username}}`.
